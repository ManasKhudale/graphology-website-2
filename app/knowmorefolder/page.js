    <div className='know-heading'>What is graphology?</div>
    <div className='know-desc'>Graphology is the study of handwriting, particularly when regarded as an expression of the writer&apos;s character, personality, and abilities. While everyone is taught a standard way of writing in school, each person&apos;s handwriting evolves uniquely as they mature. This evolution reflects individual likes, dislikes, and ultimately, their distinct personality traits. Handwriting becomes a mirror of one&apos;s inner self, as unique as their DNA.</div>
    <div className='know-heading'>Why does handwriting change?</div>
    <div className='know-desc'>Our personalities influence how our handwriting develops after we first learn to write. Handwriting is essentially a pattern of our psychology expressed in symbols on a page. These symbols are unique to each person, just like a fingerprint. As you become familiar with someone&apos;s handwriting, you recognize it as distinctly as you would recognize their face or voice.</div>
    <div className='know-heading'>The Science and Art of Graphology</div>
    <div className='know-desc'>Graphology is both a science and an art. As a science, it measures the structure and movement of written forms—slants, angles, spacing, and pressure—with great precision. As an art, it requires the graphologist to consider the overall context and the &apos;gestalt&apos; of the writing. A graphologist studies variations in movement, spacing, and form, and interprets these variations to understand the writer&apos;s psychological profile.</div>
    <div className='know-heading'>Purpose of Graphology</div>
    <div className='know-desc'>The primary purpose of graphology is to provide a realistic view of the problems that people face in their daily lives. It helps in understanding an individual&apos;s unique personality and behavior without any bias, offering insights that might not be apparent through other means.</div>
    <div className='know-heading'>Benefits of Graphology</div>
    <div className='know-desc'>

        <li> Unbiased Personality Analysis: Handwriting is a universal skill that does not discriminate against sex, race, color, or creed. Graphology provides an unbiased outline of an individual&apos;s personality and behavior without their presence.</li>
        <li> Insight into Subconscious Motivations: It reveals how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, showing the motivations behind their actions and providing information that might not be easily established through other methods.</li>
        <li>Accuracy and Depth: Expert graphologists can achieve a high degree of accuracy in their analyses, making it a powerful tool for understanding personality and behavior.</li>
